# Development Log

This log records engineering checkpoints and reproducible evidence. It is not a research-results log.

## 2026-09-20 — Issue #1 verified locally

- PostgreSQL development and dedicated test databases configured.
- Alembic migration `0001` applied successfully.
- Full suite passed: 27/27 tests.
- FastAPI application started successfully.
- `GET /health` returned `200 {"status":"ok"}`.
- Complaint create, retrieve and list endpoints returned their expected success responses.
- Created complaint persistence was confirmed in PostgreSQL.

No Issue #1 behavior was changed during this documentation checkpoint.

### Non-blocking dependency deprecation warnings

1. FastAPI's test client reported that using `httpx` with `starlette.testclient` is deprecated and recommends `httpx2`.
2. Starlette's test client uses the deprecated `anyio.abc.BlockingPortal` alias instead of `anyio.from_thread.BlockingPortal`.
3. Alembic reported legacy `prepend_sys_path` splitting because `path_separator` is not set in `alembic.ini`.

The warnings did not fail tests or affect the verified complaint flow. They are recorded for deliberate dependency/configuration maintenance rather than being suppressed or addressed by changing Issue #1 behavior.

## 2026-09-20 — Issue #2 started

Issue #2 scope is a minimal React complaint form and stored-complaint list using the existing anonymous API. The implementation must include loading, empty, validation and backend-error states and must not add authentication, images, maps or ML features.
